I’m a hands-on security professional with over 11 years of engineering experience, including the past 3 focused on securing high-impact multi-cloud transformations across AWS, Azure, GCP, and Oracle Cloud.

I specialize in building secure-by-default CI/CD workflows, embedding policy-as-code, secrets scanning, and SCA into GitLab pipelines, and aligning enterprise security strategy with frameworks like NIST RMF, ISO 27001, SOC 2, NIST 800-53, and the AWS Well-Architected Framework. My recent work includes leading the delivery, enablement, and governance of 100+ internal-facing third-party SaaS security architecture reviews, establishing risk-aligned adoption standards across enterprise and functional business units.
